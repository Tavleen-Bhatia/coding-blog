    <title>A physically motivated galaxy size definition across different
  state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations</title>
    <summary>  Galaxy sizes are a key parameter to distinguishing between different galaxy
types and morphologies, reflecting their formation and assembly histories.
Several methods define galaxy boundaries, often relying on light concentration
or isophotal densities. However, these approaches were often constrained by
observational limitations and did not necessarily provide a clear physical
boundary for galaxy outskirts. With modern deep imaging surveys, a new
physically motivated definition has emerged using the radial position of the
star formation threshold as the galaxy size, approximated by the stellar mass
density contour at 1 Msun pc^-2 (R_1). We test this definition using three
state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation suites, analyzing stellar surface
density profiles across a wide range of stellar masses and redshifts. We
measure the galaxy sizes according to this new definition and compare them with
the most traditional size metric, the stellar half-mass radius. Our analysis
demonstrates that the R_1-M_star relation exhibits consistent behaviour across
both low and high-stellar mass galaxies, with remarkably low scatter. This
relation is independent of redshift and holds across the three different
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites, highlighting its robustness to
variations in galaxy formation models. Furthermore, we explore the connection
between a galaxy's total mass within R1 and its stellar mass, finding very
little scatter in this relation. This suggests that R1 could serve as a
reliable observational tracer for the galaxy's dynamical mass. The size-stellar
mass relation proposed provides a reliable and physically motivated method for
defining the outskirts of galaxies. This method remains consistent not only at
z=0 but also throughout the evolutionary history of galaxies, offering a robust
and meaningful framework for galaxy evolution studies.

    <title>Sim-to-Real Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Dexterous
  Manipulation on Humanoids</title>
    <summary>  Reinforcement learning has delivered promising results in achieving human- or
even superhuman-level capabilities across diverse problem domains, but success
in dexterous robot manipulation remains limited. This work investigates the key
challenges in applying reinforcement learning to solve a collection of
contact-rich manipulation tasks on a humanoid embodiment. We introduce novel
techniques to overcome the identified challenges with empirical validation. Our
main contributions include an automated real-to-sim tuning module that brings
the simulated environment closer to the real world, a generalized reward design
scheme that simplifies reward engineering for long-horizon contact-rich
manipulation tasks, a divide-and-conquer distillation process that improves the
sample efficiency of hard-exploration problems while maintaining sim-to-real
performance, and a mixture of sparse and dense object representations to bridge
the sim-to-real perception gap. We show promising results on three humanoid
dexterous manipulation tasks, with ablation studies on each technique. Our work
presents a successful approach to learning humanoid dexterous manipulation
using sim-to-real reinforcement learning, achieving robust generalization and
high performance without the need for human demonstration.

    <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization
  group study</title>
    <summary>  From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase
the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely
repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac
insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such
systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators.
Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the
topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local
four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting
superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic
selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within
the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions
with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave
(conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can
in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials
for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi
surfaces.

    <title>R2-T2: Re-Routing in Test-Time for Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts</title>
    <summary>  In large multimodal models (LMMs), the perception of non-language modalities
(e.g., visual representations) is usually not on par with the large language
models (LLMs)' powerful reasoning capabilities, deterring LMMs' performance on
challenging downstream tasks. This weakness has been recently mitigated by
replacing the vision encoder with a mixture-of-experts (MoE), which provides
rich, multi-granularity, and diverse representations required by diverse
downstream tasks. The performance of multimodal MoE largely depends on its
router, which reweights and mixes the representations of different experts for
each input. However, we find that the end-to-end trained router does not always
produce the optimal routing weights for every test sample. To bridge the gap,
we propose a novel and efficient method "Re-Routing in Test-Time(R2-T2) that
locally optimizes the vector of routing weights in test-time by moving it
toward those vectors of the correctly predicted samples in a neighborhood of
the test sample. We propose three R2-T2 strategies with different optimization
objectives and neighbor-search spaces. R2-T2 consistently and greatly improves
state-of-the-art LMMs' performance on challenging benchmarks of diverse tasks,
without training any base-model parameters.

    <title>Walking the Web of Concept-Class Relationships in Incrementally Trained
  Interpretable Models</title>
    <summary>  Concept-based methods have emerged as a promising direction to develop
interpretable neural networks in standard supervised settings. However, most
works that study them in incremental settings assume either a static concept
set across all experiences or assume that each experience relies on a distinct
set of concepts. In this work, we study concept-based models in a more
realistic, dynamic setting where new classes may rely on older concepts in
addition to introducing new concepts themselves. We show that concepts and
classes form a complex web of relationships, which is susceptible to
degradation and needs to be preserved and augmented across experiences. We
introduce new metrics to show that existing concept-based models cannot
preserve these relationships even when trained using methods to prevent
catastrophic forgetting, since they cannot handle forgetting at concept, class,
and concept-class relationship levels simultaneously. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method - MuCIL - that uses multimodal concepts to perform
classification without increasing the number of trainable parameters across
experiences. The multimodal concepts are aligned to concepts provided in
natural language, making them interpretable by design. Through extensive
experimentation, we show that our approach obtains state-of-the-art
classification performance compared to other concept-based models, achieving
over 2$\times$ the classification performance in some cases. We also study the
ability of our model to perform interventions on concepts, and show that it can
localize visual concepts in input images, providing post-hoc interpretations.
